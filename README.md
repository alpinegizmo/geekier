#Summary
A saner (and geekier!) approach to working with APIs.

#Background
For background info, see the [blog post](http://thisblog.rules.io/blog/2012/12/06/the-last-gem-you-will-ever-need/) and the [wiki](https://github.com/rulesio/geekier/wiki/Home).

#API Descriptions
In the api_descriptions directory you can find a set of description files that are language agnostic and supposed to be used with an API factory

#API Factories
The job of API factories is to turn the machine-readable api description into objects (or data structures and a set of functions) that can then be used to talk to the configured API.

##Ruby
Here you can find the [ruby implementation of the factory](https://github.com/rulesio/geekier_factory_gem)

#Participate
Please join us in the [Geekier Google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/geekier-apis)

Also feel free to contribute to the api_description folder - by forking and sending pull requests for example - and to provide more implementations of API factories so that everyone can play.
